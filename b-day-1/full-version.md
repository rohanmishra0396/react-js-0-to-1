# Zero to One?

JavaScript was developed and released in a hurry.

Java applets failed. That made JavaScript the default language of the web.

Its popularity is alomst completely independent of its 
qualities as a programmng language.

JavaScript is an important language because it is the language of the web browser. 
Its association with the browser makes it one of the most popular programming 
languages in the world. At the same time, it is one of the most despised programming 
languages in the world.

The API of the browser, the Document Object Model (DOM) is quite awful, and JavaScript 
is unfairly blamed. The DOM would be painful to work with in any language. The DOM is 
poorly specified and inconsistently implemented.

The amazing thing about JavaScript is that it is possible to get work done with it 
without knowing much about the language, or even knowing much about programming.

JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is 
one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% 
of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating 
third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute the code on users' devices.

# Variable
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables

A variable is a container for a value
Variables are case sensitive
Avoid using JavaScript reserved words

```js
let myName;
let myAge;

myName;
myAge;

myName = 'Chris';
myAge = 37;
```

# Good name examples:

```js
age
myAge
init
initialColor
finalOutputValue
audio1
audio2
```

# Variable Types

## Numbers

You don't need to declare variable types in JavaScript, unlike some other programming languages.

```js
let myAge = 17;
```

## Strings

wrap it in single or double quote marks

```js
let dolphinGoodbye = 'So long and thanks for all the fish';
```

**Use `const` when you can, and use `let` when you have to.**
